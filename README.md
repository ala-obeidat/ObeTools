# ObeTools
 
C# .net standard library to help any developer in his project.
It contains my hole experience (which 8+ years) to optimize and collect what I need for every project that I create.

### It has many static classes:
  - 1 => EncryptHasher: Handle encryption/decryption and hashing methods
  - 2 => ExcelHelper: Create/read excel file with modren design (.xlsx)
  - 3 => Logger: Nice and simple thread safe text logger
  - 4 => TLVEncoding: Tag length value encoding helper (support UTF8)
  - 5 => VATHelper: Calculate VAT taxes
  - 6 => FileHelper: Get information about files from content base64
  - 7 => NumberHelper: Convert number to words, also Round double ex: if x=2.55455444; so round(x,2) =>2.55
  - 8 => Base1024Encoding: Encode and decode data using a custom base-1024 numeral system; particularly useful for compact encoding of large data using a diverse set of characters.
